## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the Github Organization for the Quantum Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Tomography (QuE-MRT) research & development project.

The project aims to build a commercially available end-to-end platform to enhance, acquire and visualize magnetic resonance signals of metabolic processes in humans by use of Hyperpolarization ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarization_(physics))). The goal is to translate Hyperpolarized (HP) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) into clinical applications in germany and worldwide. The project is funded by the german agency Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) for four years (2022 - 2026) and brings together three german universities and four companies.

This GitHub repository contains the developments we will conduct on the acquisition and visualization parts of the project. We aim to create a forum here for everybody in the HP MRI community. The goal is to exchange and jointly develop advanced methods for vendor agnostic MR data processing, visualization and structured reporting while lowering the barrier for radiologists to utilize the techniques. It requires whole toolboxes of functions and algorithms taylored towards compatibility with the software that radiologists are accustomed to use to in their day-to-day routine.
It will include up-to-date forks from scientific repositories world-wide that contain state-of-the-art methods in HP MRI processing. We will create a repository that includes clean code specifically designed for clinical studies. And we will provide a MRI sandbox repository for joint development of tomorrows algorithms in metabolic imaging using HP MRI.

### We're just about to start / more information will follow soon
